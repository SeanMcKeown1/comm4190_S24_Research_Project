# COMM4190 Spring 2024 - Research Project

### Overview

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For my paper, I am discussing the implications of Agenda Setting for an LLM. Agenda setting, the process by which those in the media decide what is important or not for coverage, greatly effects what the general public perceives as pertinent. This process has it's benefits and downsides, since the agenda set by the media can range in effectiveness or importance. Including a narrative can cause outrage, telling a different version of events can cause panic, and it's usually all up to members of the media to decide.

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Since the media constitutes the training data of an LLM (in this case Llama), their agenda setting must have an impact on the outputs LLMs have. On top of this, I am interested in seeing how the agenda's given by the media differ from that of an LLM. Once the differences are made clear, I hope to analyze if LLMs benefit the user through however it changes the agendas original presented by the media.

### Method

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To research the effects of LLMs, I will be analyzing two news stories through the lens of the agendas that have been set by different media outlets. I will then compare LLama's output regarding the same story to see how LLama changes the agendas output by the media. By comparing the different outputs, the story at hand, and surrounding context, I will analyze how the use of an LLM might help or hurt when providing information on topics from the news in regards to the agenda it puts forth.
