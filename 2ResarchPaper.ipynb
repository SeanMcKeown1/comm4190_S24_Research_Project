    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For the second portion of this paper, I will analyze how one of the most advanced LLMs (LLama-3) handles reporting on certain events. These events will be chosen for their mass reporting, divisive nature, and relation to news coverage. I selected two events from 2010 (Haiti earthquakes, and Wikileaks) because the A.I. will have access to them, and there will be plenty of data on the topics to collect from.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Agenda Setting Theory posits that the media plays a significant role in shaping public opinion by selecting and emphasizing certain issues, thereby influencing what people consider important. Agenda Setting, will be measured, in this case, by the framing the LLM will provide. Exploring the implications of Agenda Setting Theory for what an LLM communicates is what I hope to study. In the context of an LLM, since the media agenda is equivalent to the training data used to develop the model, the media sets the agenda for what the LLM considers important and what it's capable of generating. I want to see how an LLM changes the framing from the media it consumes, and if these changes cause a significant impact on the message being shared. \n",

    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For the first story, I will be comparing Llama’s synopsis to the agenda presented by CBS, The Guardian, and New York Times. Wikileaks was a data leak organized by Julian Assange that revealed a massive cache of classified documents related to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The releases included:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Afghan War Diary: Over 75,000 documents detailing U.S. military operations in Afghanistan from 2004 to 2009. Initial release of July 25th, 2010.\n",
    "- Iraq War Logs: Nearly 400,000 documents detailing U.S. military operations in Iraq from 2004 to 2009. Initial release of October 22, 2010.\n",
    "- U.S. State Department Cables:  Massive cache of over 250,000 confidential cables from the U.S. State Department, which became known as Cablegate. Initial release of November 28, 2010\n",
    "\n",
    "*CBS* https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-wikileaks-enlightened-us-in-2010/\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The article \"How WikiLeaks enlightened us in 2010\" by Dan Rather, published on CBS News in 2010, discusses the significance of WikiLeaks' revelations and how they challenged the traditional narrative presented by the mainstream media. Rather argues that these revelations were a crucial step towards transparency and accountability, and that they challenged the dominant narrative presented by the mainstream media. He criticizes the media for its complicity in perpetuating the government's line, and for failing to scrutinize the official story.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Rather suggests that the media's failure to critically examine the government's narrative on the wars and diplomacy led to a distorted public understanding of these issues. Rather contends that the media's agenda-setting power is exercised in several ways, including selective reporting, framing the narrative, and lack of scrutiny by highlighting the significance of WikiLeaks' revelations. He suggests that a more diverse and critical media landscape is essential for promoting transparency, accountability, and a more informed public discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Guardian* https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/jun/10/wikileaks-guardian-cables-2010\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The article \"Flurry of leaked US embassy cables reveal foreign strategies\" published in The Guardian on November 29, 2010, reports on the initial release of the WikiLeaks US embassy cables. The article announces the release of over 250,000 confidential US State Department cables, obtained by WikiLeaks, which provide unprecedented insight into US foreign policy and diplomacy. The cables, dated from 1966 to 2010, reveal sensitive information about governments, leaders, and diplomatic relations around the world. The article highlights several key revelations from the initial release, including US attempts to influence foreign leaders, criticism of foreign governments, US spying on UN officials, and Saudi Arabia's fears about Iran.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Agenda presented by the article focuses on making the leaks act as an exposé of US foreign policy. The article frames the release of the cables as a significant blow towards trust in US foreign policy, revealing the inner workings of US diplomacy and the often-secretive nature of international relations. Overall, the article presents an agenda that is critical of US power and influence, and promotes transparency and accountability in government. It frames the release of the cables as a significant event in the pursuit of truth and accountability, and reinforces The Guardian's reputation as a progressive and independent newspaper.\n",
    "\n",
    "*New York Times* https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/business/media/13carr.html\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The article \"WikiLeaks Taps Power of the Press\" by the New York Times, published on December 10, 2010, discusses the collaboration between WikiLeaks and several major newspapers, including the New York Times, The Guardian, and Der Spiegel, to release a massive trove of confidential US State Department cables. The article describes the unprecedented collaboration between WikiLeaks and the newspapers, which involved redacting sensitive information, verifying the authenticity of the cables, and coordinating the release of the documents. The article highlights the significance of the release, which provides an unparalleled glimpse into the inner workings of US foreign policy and diplomacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the article presents an agenda that is supportive of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, while also promoting the value of investigative journalism and the importance of transparency and accountability in government. It reinforces the New York Times' reputation as a champion of investigative journalism and establishes a new model for collaborative reporting. It also greatly downputs the impact of the effect on national security.\n",

    "Prompt: Please give me a synopsis of the 2010 Wikileaks events based on reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "    Response: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The 2010 WikiLeaks events refer to the massive leak of confidential documents and cables from the United States government, which were published by WikiLeaks, a non-profit organization founded by Julian Assange. Here is a synopsis of the events based on reporting:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Background*\n",
    "\n",
    "    In 2009, WikiLeaks received a large cache of classified documents from an anonymous source, later identified as Chelsea Manning, a U.S. Army intelligence analyst. The documents included sensitive information about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as diplomatic cables from the U.S. State Department.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Release of the Afghan War Logs (July 25, 2010)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    On July 25, 2010, WikiLeaks released over 75,000 documents related to the war in Afghanistan, which became known as the Afghan War Logs. The documents revealed previously unknown details about civilian casualties, Taliban attacks, and corruption within the Afghan government. The release sparked widespread media attention and criticism of the U.S. military's handling of the war.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Release of the Iraq War Logs (October 22, 2010)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    On October 22, 2010, WikiLeaks released over 390,000 documents related to the war in Iraq, which became known as the Iraq War Logs. The documents revealed new information about the number of civilian casualties, torture, and abuse by Iraqi security forces, as well as the involvement of private security contractors in the war.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Release of the U.S. State Department Cables (November 28, 2010)*\n",
    "\n",
    "    On November 28, 2010, WikiLeaks began releasing a massive cache of over 250,000 confidential cables from the U.S. State Department, which became known as Cablegate. The cables revealed sensitive information about U.S. foreign policy, including diplomatic communications between U.S. embassies and the State Department, as well as confidential assessments of foreign leaders.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Key Revelations*\n",
    "\n",
    "    The WikiLeaks releases revealed a range of sensitive information, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Civilian casualties: The Afghan and Iraq War Logs revealed that the U.S. military had significantly underreported the number of civilian casualties in both wars.\n",
    "    * Torture and abuse: The Iraq War Logs revealed widespread torture and abuse of detainees by Iraqi security forces, as well as the involvement of private security contractors in the abuse.\n",
    "    * Corruption: The Afghan War Logs revealed corruption and nepotism within the Afghan government, including embezzlement and bribery.\n",
    "    * Diplomatic tensions: The State Department cables revealed sensitive information about U.S. diplomatic relations with foreign governments, including criticism of foreign leaders and discussions about sensitive issues like nuclear proliferation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Consequences*\n",
    "\n",
    "    The WikiLeaks releases had significant consequences, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Criminal investigation: The U.S. government launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, which led to Assange's eventual arrest in 2019.\n",
    "    * Diplomatic fallout: The release of the State Department cables led to diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and foreign governments, including the withdrawal of U.S. ambassadors from several countries.\n",
    "    * Manning's arrest: Chelsea Manning, the alleged source of the leaks, was arrested in May 2010 and later convicted of espionage and theft.\n",
    "    * WikiLeaks' financial blockade: In response to the releases, several financial institutions, including PayPal and Visa, blocked WikiLeaks' accounts, making it difficult for the organization to receive donations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Overall, the 2010 WikiLeaks events marked a significant moment in the history of whistleblowing and government transparency, and had far-reaching consequences for U.S. foreign policy and national security.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When comparing the agenda’s presented by three main news websites to what Llama dictates, there are a few major takeaways. The news articles focused greatly on their own personal agenda being set. CBS focused on direct coverage of what was revealed while critiquing the media’s coverage previously. The second article holds a similar frame, equally as critical of the previous forms of coverage. Lastly, the New York Times focuses on the importance of this event for journalism as a whole as they recap how they handled covering the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Llama, in this case, removes all of these agendas from the narrative. Instead of focusing on the reveal in relation to journalism, Llama simply gives a detailed account of events. This agenda stripping reveals more about the impact these events had, the timeline, and the key events. Overall, I believe these changes made by the LLM help the telling of truthful information. The LLM correctly orders the information, provides important recapping, while dictating the impacts around the world - all things that aren’t exactly included in the media coverage. This is most likely due to the LLM removing the human based agenda setting perspective.\n",

    "### Haiti Earthquakes In The News\n",
    "\n",
    "![Destruction In Haiti](Photos/Haiti.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;For the second story, I will be comparing Llama’s synopsis to the agenda presented by CNN, The Guardian, and New York Times. The event was a devastating earthquake that struck Haiti, causing widespread destruction and loss of life on January 12th, 2010. The earthquake was followed by several powerful aftershocks, including a 6.1-magnitude quake on January 20.  The earthquake led to a massive humanitarian crisis, with estimates suggesting that up to 300,000 people were killed and over 1 million displaced. The disaster also brought attention to Haiti's poverty and infrastructure issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "*CNN* https://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/12/haiti.earthquake/index.html\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In \"7.0 quake hits Haiti; 'Serious loss of life' expected\", published by CNN, Mallory Simon reports on how the powerful 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, causing widespread destruction and panic. The quake's epicenter was located about 10 miles southwest of the capital city of Port-au-Prince, and the impact was felt across the country. The article reports that a \"serious loss of life\" is expected, with multiple buildings collapsed, roads blocked, and emergency services overwhelmed. The Haitian government has declared a state of emergency, and international aid efforts are underway.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The agendas being presented in this article are plenty. First, the existence of a Humanitarian Crisis acts as the primary agenda of the article, emphasizing the severity of the situation and the need for international aid and assistance. From there, the article goes into the disaster response, global outreach, and the lack of infrastructure that caused the problem. Finally, the article has an emotional appeal that calls for readers to have sympathy for the struggling nation. Overall, the article presents a comprehensive and empathetic report on the devastating earthquake in Haiti, while also promoting a range of agendas related to humanitarian response, global solidarity, and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "*The Guardian* https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jan/13/tsunami-alert-haiti-earthquake-disaster\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;In \"Many feared dead as huge earthquake hits Haiti\", published by The Guardian, the writers go over the basic details of the event similarly stated by the previous article. This article more so focuses on an emotional telling of the event, with more sympathy throughout. They share reports that many people are feared dead, with multiple buildings collapsed, including hospitals, schools, and homes. Also that emergency services are struggling to respond to the disaster, and international aid efforts are underway.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The previous agendas provided by the first article are also included in this article, but The Guardian further provides insight into Haiti’s vulnerability and the surrounding political/economic context of the event.  Specifically, the article is more critical of nations that could be doing more, and the systemic problems in Haiti. The largest agenda present, though, is that of the U.S. perspective. The Guardian speaks to the current president, Obama, and former President Clinton on the topic of these events. On top of this, they reach out to U.N. correspondents and Haitian communications worker in New York. These interviews and perspective frame the article around the U.S. response and care for the people of Haiti, despite the overwhelmingly sympathetic tone of the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*The New York Times* https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/world/americas/13haiti.html\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;The article \"Fierce Quake Devastates Haitian Capital\" by the New York Times, reports same day coverage of the devastating earthquake that struck Port-au-Prince, Haiti on January 12, 2010. The article describes the same events as the previous two, but this article quotes eyewitnesses, rescue workers, and officials, highlighting the challenges of responding to the disaster and the dire need for international aid. Overall, the article presents a powerful and emotive portrayal of the earthquake's impact, while also promoting a sense of global responsibility and encouraging readers to support humanitarian efforts. The agendas presented in the article are largely focused on promoting aid, cooperation, and development, rather than pushing a specific political or ideological agenda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Llama’s synopsis of Haiti's Earthquakes\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here is a synopsis of the devastating earthquakes that struck Haiti in 2010:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *The Earthquakes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "    *January 12, 2010:* A magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Haiti at 16:53 local time (21:53 UTC). The epicenter was located approximately 25 kilometers (16 miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince, the capital city of Haiti.\n",
    "    *January 20, 2010:* A magnitude 6.1 aftershock struck Haiti, causing further damage and panic.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Effects of the Earthquakes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Death toll:* Estimated to be between 220,000 to 300,000 people, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in history.\n",
    "    * *Injuries:* Over 300,000 people were injured, many seriously.\n",
    "    * *Displacement:* Approximately 1.5 million people were left homeless, with many forced to live in makeshift camps or on the streets.\n",
    "    * *Infrastructure damage:* The earthquakes caused widespread destruction to buildings, roads, bridges, and other critical infrastructure.\n",
    "        + *Port-au-Prince:* The city was particularly affected, with an estimated 60% of buildings destroyed or severely damaged.\n",
    "        + *Government buildings:* The Presidential Palace, the National Assembly, and other government buildings were severely damaged or destroyed.\n",
    "        + *Hospitals:* Many hospitals were damaged or destroyed, leaving the healthcare system severely compromised.\n",
    "        + *Schools:* Thousands of schools were destroyed or damaged, affecting the education system.\n",
    "    * *Economic impact:* The earthquakes caused significant economic losses, with estimates suggesting that Haiti's economy shrunk by 5.1% in 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Response and Recovery:*\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *International response:* The international community responded rapidly, with many countries providing aid, personnel, and resources to assist in the relief efforts.\n",
    "    * *Humanitarian aid:* Food, water, shelter, and medical supplies were distributed to affected populations.\n",
    "    * *Reconstruction efforts:* The Haitian government, with international support, launched a reconstruction program aimed at rebuilding infrastructure, housing, and critical facilities.\n",
    "    * *Challenges:* The recovery process was slow and challenging, with issues such as corruption, lack of coordination, and limited resources hindering progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Long-term Impact:*\n",
    "\n",
    "    * *Haiti's development:* The earthquakes set back Haiti's development by decades, exacerbating existing challenges such as poverty, inequality, and vulnerability to natural disasters.\n",
    "    * *Psychological trauma:* The trauma caused by the earthquakes had a lasting impact on the Haitian people, particularly children and those who lost loved ones.\n",
    "    * *Infrastructure:* While some progress has been made in rebuilding infrastructure, many communities still lack access to basic services such as clean water, sanitation, and electricity.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Remembering the devastating earthquakes in Haiti serves as a reminder of the importance of disaster preparedness, resilience, and international cooperation in the face of natural disasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analysis:** \n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;When comparing the agenda setting and its impacts in these articles versus LLama, I believe that LLama removes the agenda’s being set once again - but in this case I feel as though the removal of agendas negatively impacts the reporting. The story being told is that of a natural disaster, an event that will have a lot of matter-of-fact reporting. That said, the reporting greatly benefits from the emotional and contextual stories that the authors focus on. When Llama tells the story, it removes the emotional aspect as well as the call for help. It also removes the dire attitude that is shared through out the more \"human\" writing styles provided by the media. These removals leave important pieces of information outside of the story. The factual and simplistic reporting by Llama explains the event and its impacts, but it fails to search for the causes and other outside narratives that the reports from CNN, The Guardian, and New York Times are able to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; That said, there is a positive to be taken away from a historical standpoint. Since the event is now over ten years old, the need for an emotional perspective is lessened. On top of this, Llama obviously benefits from having up-to-date information regarding what happened after the earthquak (something the media outlets obviously were prevented from obtaining).\n",
